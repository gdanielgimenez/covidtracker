technologies : React {class Component,hooks, react-chart-js-2}
               axios {to fetch data from the api}
               Material-UI {for the styling}
obj : fetch data from the api to display the global numbers in 3 cards and a chart, fill the select with all the countries options and change the cards and the chart according to the selected country data.

obs: some countries may have a zero value for the "recovered" or "deaths" cards, that's an api issue with the data for a couple of countries.
